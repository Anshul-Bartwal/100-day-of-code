# Day 74 - Coding Challenge

## Question 1  
**Problem:**  
Take two filenames from the user – a source file and a destination file. Copy all the content from the source file to the destination file using fgetc() and fputc().

**File Used**
- [source.txt](source.txt)
- [destination.txt](destination.txt) (will be created by the program)

**Code:**  
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    FILE *src = fopen("source.txt", "r");
    FILE *dest = fopen("destination.txt", "w");
    char ch;
    while((ch = fgetc(src)) != EOF){
        fputc(ch, dest);
    }
    printf("File Copied Successfully");
    fclose(src);
    fclose(dest);
    return 0;

}
```

**Sample Output:**  
```
File Copied Successfully
```
