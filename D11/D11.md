# Day 11 - Coding Challenge

## Question 1  
**Problem:**  
Write a program to display the month name and number of days using switch-case for a given month number.

**Code:**  
```c
# include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int month;
    printf("Enter the month number (1-12): ");
    scanf("%d", &month);
    switch (month) {
        case 1: printf("January has 31 days\n"); break;
        case 2: printf("February has 28 days\n"); break;
        case 3: printf("March has 31 days\n"); break;
        case 4: printf("April has 30 days\n"); break;
        case 5: printf("May has 31 days\n"); break;
        case 6: printf("June has 30 days\n"); break;
        case 7: printf("July has 31 days\n"); break;
        case 8: printf("August has 31 days\n"); break;
        case 9: printf("September has 30 days\n"); break;
        case 10: printf("October has 31 days\n"); break;
        case 11: printf("November has 30 days\n"); break;
        case 12: printf("December has 31 days\n"); break;
        default: printf("Invalid month number\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Sample Output:**  
```
Enter the month number (1-12): 12  
December has 31 days


Enter the month number (1-12): 14
Invalid month number


Enter the month number (1-12): 2
February has 28 days
```

## Question 2  
**Problem:**  
Write a program to find profit or loss percentage given cost price and selling price.

**Code:**  
```c

# include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int cp, sp;
    float profit_loss, percentage;
    printf("Enter cost price and selling price: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &cp, &sp);
    profit_loss = sp - cp;
    if (profit_loss > 0) {
        percentage = (profit_loss / cp) * 100;
        printf("Profit %.2f%%\n", percentage); // here %% means % will be displayed in output
    } else if (profit_loss < 0) {
        percentage = (-profit_loss / cp) * 100;
        printf("Loss %.2f%%\n", percentage);
    } else {
        printf("No profit, no loss\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Sample Output:**  
```
Enter cost price and selling price: 100 100
No profit, no loss


Enter cost price and selling price: 1000 800
Loss 20.00%


Enter cost price and selling price: 1000 1200
Profit 20.00%
```
