# Day 71 - Coding Challenge

## Question 1  
**Problem:**  
Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

**Code:**  
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    char name[100];
    printf("Enter name: ");
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    int age;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d",&age);

    FILE *pFile = fopen("info.txt", "w");

    fprintf(pFile,"Name: %sAge: %d\n",name,age);
    printf("Data successfully saved to info.txt\n");
    fclose(pFile);
}
```

**Sample Output:**  
```
Enter name: Anshul
Enter your age: 100
Data successfully saved to info.txt
```
