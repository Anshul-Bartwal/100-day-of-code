# Day 76 - Coding Challenge

## Question 1  
**Problem:**  
Ask the user for a filename. Check if it exists by trying to open it in read mode. If the file pointer is NULL, print an error message; otherwise, read and display its content.

**File Used**
- test.txt

**Code:**  
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    FILE *f1 = fopen("test.txt", "r");
    if (f1==NULL) {
        printf("Error: File does not exist.");
        return 1;
    }
    printf("File opened successfully.");
    fclose(f1);
    return 0;
}
```

**Sample Output:**  
Before creating test.txt:

```
Error: File does not exist.
```

After creating test.txt
``` 
File opened successfully.
```
